# Plasma

Plasma is a free digital audio effect for VST3 hosts. With its asymmetrical distortion and warm filters, Plasma is the perfect tool for creating aggressive and unique sounds in hard dance genres like Gabber, Hardstyle, and Hardcore.

However, Plasma is not just limited to hard dance genres – it's a versatile tool that can be used in any music production scenario. Use it to add grit and character to your guitar tracks or to create punishing basslines in your dubstep tracks. The possibilities with Plasma are endless.

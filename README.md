# Plasma
Plasma is a free digital audio effect targeting VST3 hosts.

It's designed as a assymetrical distortion inspired by Logic's Clips Distortion, but offers more tools to shape the sound and create aggressive sounds.
Plasma ist primarly designed for hard dance genres like Gabber, Hardstyle or Hardcore.

We offer prebuild binaries for Windows 64 bit.
Mac and Linux releases are planned for the near future. 

# Features

Plasma is equiped with 2 disortion modules and a filter section between them.
The filter section gives you more options then the classic "tone knob" other clip distortions use. Combined with the second distortion you can create a nice character in one plugin.

You are also not limited to using normal clip distortion. Plasma comes with 8 diffrent styles of distortion. On top of that you get a nice oscilloscope to see how you shape the waveform of your sound.

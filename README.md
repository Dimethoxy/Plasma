# Plasma

Plasma is a free & open-source distortion powerhouse for VST3 hosts. Originally designed for Hardstyle, Gabber, Hardcore, and anything that needs raw, aggressive energy, Plasma lets you twist and destroy your sound with 12 brutal distortion styles and filters with extreme resonance capabilities.

But don’t box it in—Plasma is a sound design weapon for any genre. Use it to add bite to guitars, weight to basslines, or grit to synths. Whether you're sculpting punishing drops or crushing breakbeats, Plasma delivers.
